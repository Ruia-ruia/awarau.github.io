title: Linux kernel Use-After-Free (CVE-2021-23134) exploitation.
use_math: true
---

## The bug
The bug is a Use After Free (UAF) in the Near-Field-Communication (NFC) subsystem of the Linux kernel (before v5.12.4).

Let $S_i$ be a socket file descriptor constructed with:

socket(AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP). 

Then suppose we bind $S_i$ to an address $A$.
$S_i$ will be loaded with a pointer to an object $L$ of type:

nfc_llcp_local

However, if the bind fails for $S_i$ then $L$ will be freed while $S_i \to L$ remains defined. So a future computation which dereferences $S_i \to L$ will transition the kernel into a weird state.

The patch removes the pointer $S_i \to L$ when $L$ is freed on bind failure.
